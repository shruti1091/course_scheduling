# course_scheduling
a java solution for the course scheduling case study from the book "An Integrated Approach to Software Engineering" by Pankaj Jalote

**Problem Description**
The computer science department in a university offers many courses every
semester, which are taught by many instructors. These courses are scheduled
based on some policy directions of the department. Currently the scheduling
is done manually, but the department would like to automate it. We have
to first understand the problem and then produce a requirements document
based on our understanding of the problem.
